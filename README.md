### "Experience"

Professional breaker and fixer of digital things. Documentation is gospel—way better than those YouTube tutorials that spend 5 minutes on intros and the next 10 on wasting your time.  
Old OVA files? Absolute _hypervisor headaches_ when it comes to networking.  
Custom Linux builds? More like _terminal tuxedo chaos_—you’re better off conjuring your own setup from a clean CLI like a true shell sorcerer.

Web development in college felt like the golden ticket—until I realized entry-level jobs require 5 years of experience, 10 projects, and maybe a soul or two.

Then came cybersecurity.  
Love at first exploit.  
Now I’m so deep, even Active Directory feels like a cursed maze with DNS demons whispering riddles.

### "Currently Learning"

- **Active Directory** – Because apparently, there’s _always_ another forest hiding a cursed trust relationship.
    
- **Privilege Escalation** – Like climbing a ladder made of exploits while dodging tripwires and cronjobs.
    
- **Cloud Security** – Aka "hacking the sky" but with billing alerts and IAM policies screaming at me.
    
- **Scripting in Python** – For when `bash` isn't enough and you want to automate your way into (or out of) chaos.
    
- **Red Team Tactics** – Learning to think like an attacker, but with more style and less jail time.
    
- **Writing Better Docs** – Because good notes are the real root shell.

### **Already Fought (and Sometimes Won)**

- **Hack The Box Machines** – Pwned boxes with everything from dumb misconfigs to AD nightmare fuel.
    
- **CTFs** – Solved flags, broke my brain, Googled like a madman, repeated.
    
- **Web App Vulns** – XSS, SQLi, LFI, RCE... the usual suspects. They scream, I patch (or exploit).
    
- **Tools of Chaos**:
    
    - **BloodHound** – For seeing AD like Batman sees Gotham.
        
    - **Impacket** – The Swiss Army knife for when Windows gets spicy.
        
    - **Burp Suite** – My love-hate relationship in proxy form.
        
    - **linpeas, winpeas** – Because you can’t escalate without knowing what’s rotting underneath.
        
- **Networking** – NAT, bridges, port forwards... pretty sure I can configure a switch in my sleep now.
